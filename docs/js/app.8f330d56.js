If you dig deep down, the concept becomes simple.The more work put in, the better result pulled out. Part of the letters from an American farmer has pointed out that “Here [In America] the rewards of his industry follow with equal steps the progress of his labour; His labour is founded on the basis of nature, self-interest”. St.John De Crevecoeur focused on the equal repayment of one's labour to connect with the American motto of “Ubi panis ibi patria” which translated to “Where there is bread, there is a country”; this emphasized on union through hard work, and how America is united through individuals that can contribute to the entire community. This is even more impressive by the fact that St. John De Crevecoeur wrote this letter only after a few years of settlement in the newly born America. In fact, the idea was even translated to the America political foundation; for instance, the failure to reward citizens with equal pay for their labour is a one of the core reasons for secession from Britain; the Congress of America stated out that the act of “Imposing on [Americans] without our Consent” and “cutting off [Americans] Trade” as a worthwhile offence among other as the reason for their independence. This showed how far America is willing to go for their rights of equal pay, even if it meant challenging the strongest monarch of the time. Furthermore, the idea of protecting American's hard-earned rewards is also ingrained in the constitution of America; rulings such as one in article 1, section 9, clause 6 were made to ensure that “No Preference shall be given by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another: nor shall Vessels bound to, or from, one State, be obliged to enter, clear or pay Duties in another”. This clause prevents Congress from showing any favouritism toward a particular state, further encouraging citizens to work without the worry of interference because of their political beliefs. On the note of citizens rights, the founding father of America have also, on multiple occasion, shown great interest in the matter; as express by James Madison in his excerpt from the Federalist no.10, “enlightened statesmen will be able to adjust these clashing interests, and render them all subservient to the public good”. The idea that Congress (statesmen) cannot interferewith the public good comes a long way to again encourage people to freely work without the fear of an oppressive government controlling their actions. But what gives? However glorious they are, these are laws and statements made from 200 years ago. But probably the most impressive fact about the American work ethic is that even after 200 years of turmoil, the idea lives on. Bill Gates started up a company and raise it to where it is through his sheer determination to bring an affordable personal computer to the people. Stories like this, of countless self-made billionaire, is a result of the few lines written 200 years ago. In the same fashion, You too can join them in the pedestal of success if you are willing to pour your heart and soul into your work.",videoComment:"## Ali Saifi is a successful entrepreneur who brought subway to South Carolina through hard work and determination.

We American hold a unique identity, “Here individuals of all nations are melted into a new race of men”; the only trait that holds any importance in America is your usefulness toward society. Thus, in America, we put it as the top priority to ensure that “All men are equal”, as proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence. We trust that this proclamation shall act upon the interest of all citizen and create a country where every citizen will be treated equally regardless of their race, religion, or political belief. In doing so, we act as a beacon to welcome all immigrants alike to America, and most importantly create a balanced foundation for all citizen. Admitted by the founding fathers who “turned away from the traditional reliance upon religious sanction and engineered a new paradox, what could be called a secular revelation…[Abraham] Lincoln urged a cult of the Constitution, a worship of ‘the Constitution and its laws,’ as the only reliable mean to preserve the legacy of self-government.  ‘Let it become,’ he proclaimed, ‘the political religion of the nation”. This idea of a country separated from religion create a strong base by which no religious bias were envolved and all laws are solely based on the will of the people. Beyond that, we have also imprinted these ideologies in multiple foundational documents, such as ruling 1.3.7, which strip senators of their protection during office which reduce the risk that corrupted official will abuse their power, or the first amendment which secures the freedom of speech, religion, assembly, and position. These are qualities that we practice daily today in America, which helps retain the balance that has helped countless others in our society to succeed. The most recognizable example is Barack Obama who became the 44th president of the United State, and also the first African American president; Barack Obama who surpasses his African American agenda is truly a testament to the core quality of Americans. We here in America hold a strong unshaken foundation of equality, but it is you who will decide how tall this house will be."}},methods:{marked:function(e){return S(e)}}},A=_,x=(o("aa2c"),Object(h["a"])(A,P,k,!1,null,"26960383",null));x.options.__file="SecondPage.vue";var T=x.exports,j=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,o=e._self._c||t;return o("div",[o("span",{domProps:{innerHTML:e._s(e.marked(e.title))}}),o("span",{domProps:{innerHTML:e._s(e.marked(e.msg))}}),o("iframe",{style:e.iframeStyle,attrs:{src:"https://stephaneginier.com/sculptgl/"}}),o("h2",[e._v("Share Your Sculpture!")]),o("span",[e._v("Click files > Save .obj to save the file")]),o("br"),o("br"),o("label",{attrs:{for:"sculptSubmit",id:"sculptSubmitButton"}},[e._v("Upload File")]),o("input",{staticStyle:{display:"none"},attrs:{type:"file",id:"sculptSubmit",accept:".obj"},on:{change:e.sendFile}}),o("h2",[e._v("Sculpture Gallery")]),o("div",{attrs:{id:"sculptShowcase"}},[o("model-obj",{attrs:{src:e.sculptSource,backgroundAlpha:"0.01"}}),o("div",{attrs:{id:"switchBar"}},[o("b",{attrs:{id:"lastPage"},on:{click:e.back}},[e._v("<")]),o("b",{attrs:{id:"nextPage"},on:{click:e.next}},[e._v(">")])])],1)])},C=[],I=o("bfb4"),H=o("0e54"),O={name:"ConclusionPage",data:function(){return{title:"# Assessment",msg:"## America is a country with great opportunities waiting to be claimed.
